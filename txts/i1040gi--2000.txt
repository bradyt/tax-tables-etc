A Message From Dear Taxpayer:
the Commissioner With the arrival of the Year 2001 tax filing season, the IRS continues to make
                        tangible improvements in the way we serve you. We have worked hard over the
                        past year to make filing and paying your taxes easier and more convenient.
                           Millions of taxpayers are visiting our Web Site at www.irs.gov to get
                        information and download forms and publications. Assistance on our toll-free
                        telephone lines continues to improve so that more taxpayers can get through and
                        get the answers they need. We are resolving long-standing problems and making
                        sure that your rights are protected. We believe that these are some very positive
                        trends upon which we can build this year, and in the years to come.
                          However, we still have a long way to go before we can provide the level and
                        quality of service that you expect and deserve. We are in the midst of the most
                        comprehensive modernization of the IRS in more than 50 years. That includes
                        changes to our organization and technology. Many years of hard work lie ahead
                        but we are committed to making the IRS work better, and work better for you.
                          Thank you.
                                                            Sincerely,



                                                            Charles O. Rossotti

 You must file a return if any of the four conditions below apply for 2000.
 1. You owe any special taxes, such as:
    ● Social security and Medicare tax on tips you did not report to your employer,

    ● Tax on an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), other retirement plan, or on a medical savings account (MSA). But if you
      are filing a return only because you owe this tax, you can file Form 5329 by itself.

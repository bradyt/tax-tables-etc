                                     The Taxpayer Advocate Service Is Here To Help You
What is the Taxpayer Advocate Service?
The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is your voice at the IRS. Our job is to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that
you know and understand your rights.
What can TAS do for you?
We can offer you free help with IRS problems that you can’t resolve on your own. We know the tax process can be confusing,
but the worst thing you can do is nothing at all! TAS can help if you can’t resolve your tax problem and:
      Your problem is causing financial difficulties for you, your family, or your business.
      You face (or your business is facing) an immediate threat of adverse action.
      You’ve tried repeatedly to contact the IRS but no one has responded, or the IRS hasn’t responded by the date promised.
If you qualify for our help, you'll be assigned to one advocate who’ll be with you at every turn and will do everything possible to
resolve your problem.
      TAS is an independent organization within the IRS. Our advocates know how to work with the IRS to get your problems
resolved.
      Our services are free and tailored to meet your needs.
      We have offices in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
      Our online tax toolkit can help you understand your rights and options in dealing with the IRS. Go to
www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Individuals/Get-Tax-Help.
How can you reach us?
If you think TAS can help you, call your local advocate, whose number is in your phone book and on our website at www.irs.gov/
advocate. You can also call us toll-free at 1-877-777-4778.
How else does TAS help taxpayers?
TAS also works to resolve large-scale, systemic problems that affect many taxpayers. If you know of one of these broad issues,
please report it to us through our Systemic Advocacy Management System at www.irs.gov/advocate.
                                        Low Income Taxpayer Clinics Help Taxpayers
Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the IRS. Some serve individuals whose income is below a certain
level and who need to resolve a tax problem. These clinics provide professional representation before the IRS or in court on
audits, appeals, tax collection disputes, and other issues for free or for a small fee. Some clinics provide information about
taxpayer rights and responsibilities in many different languages for individuals who speak English as a second language. For
more information, and to find a clinic near you, read the LITC page on www.irs.gov/advocate or IRS Publication 4134, Low
Income Taxpayer Clinic List. You can also get this publication at your local IRS office or by calling 1-800-829-3676.

   *If you were born on January 1, 1948, you are considered to be age 65 at the end of 2012.
   **Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt
   from tax, including any income from sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you
   can exclude part or all of it). Do not include any social security benefits unless (a) you are married filing a separate
   return and you lived with your spouse at any time in 2012 or (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your other
   gross income and any tax-exempt interest is more than $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see
   the instructions for lines 20a and 20b to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross
   income. Gross income includes gains, but not losses, reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D. Gross income from a
   business means, for example, the amount on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9. But, in figuring gross income, do
   not reduce your income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9.
   ***If you did not live with your spouse at the end of 2012 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at
   least $3,800, you must file a return regardless of your age.

someone can claim you as a dependent.)
If your parent (or someone else) can claim you as a dependent, use this chart to see if you must file a return.
   In this chart, unearned income includes taxable interest, ordinary dividends, and capital gain distributions. It also includes
unemployment compensation, taxable social security benefits, pensions, annuities, and distributions of unearned income from a
trust. Earned income includes salaries, wages, tips, professional fees, and taxable scholarship and fellowship grants. Gross
income is the total of your unearned and earned income.

Single dependents. Were you either age 65 or older or blind?
       No. You must file a return if any of the following apply.
             Your unearned income was over $950.
             Your earned income was over $5,950.

              $950, or

       Yes. You must file a return if any of the following apply.
             Your unearned income was over $2,400 ($3,850 if 65 or older and blind).
             Your earned income was over $7,400 ($8,850 if 65 or older and blind).
             Your gross income was more than the larger of—

                                           worksheet instead of Pub. 535 to figure your deduction.
  1. Enter the total amount paid in 2012 for health insurance coverage established under your business
     (or the S corporation in which you were a more-than-2% shareholder) for 2012 for you, your
     spouse, and your dependents. Your insurance can also cover your child who was under age 27 at
     the end of 2012, even if the child was not your dependent. But do not include amounts for any
     month you were eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored health plan or amounts paid from

 *If you used either optional method to figure your net earnings from self-employment, do not enter your net profit. Instead, enter the
    amount from Schedule SE, Section B, line 4b.
 **Earned income includes net earnings and gains from the sale, transfer, or licensing of property you created. However, it does not include
   capital gain income. If you were a more-than-2% shareholder in the S corporation under which the insurance plan is established, earned
   income is your Medicare wages (box 5 of Form W-2) from that corporation.

use either of those worksheets to figure the tax on line 4 above. Complete the rest of that worksheet through line 6 (line 10 if you use the
Schedule D Tax Worksheet). Next, you must determine if you have a capital gain excess. To find out if you have a capital gain excess, subtract
Form 1040, line 43, from line 6 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet (line 10 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet). If
the result is more than zero, that amount is your capital gain excess.

complete lines 5 and 6 above.
  If you have a capital gain excess, complete a second Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet
(whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then complete lines 5 and 6 above.
These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.
  1. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 3 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax
   Worksheet or line 9 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by your capital gain excess.
  2. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 2 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax
   Worksheet or line 6 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by any of your capital gain excess not used in (1) above.
  3. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount on your Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, by your capital gain excess.
  4. Include your capital gain excess as a loss on line 16 of your Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet in the Instructions for
   Schedule D (Form 1040).

A Message From           Dear Taxpayer,
the Commissioner            Every year, the IRS works hard to make the process of filing your taxes as
                         quick and easy as possible. Providing quality service is one of our top priorities.
                         It not only reduces the burden on you, but also helps you file an accurate return
                         right from the start.
                            The best place to get information from the IRS is our website, IRS.gov. In
                         addition to getting your tax questions answered, there’s also a very popular
                         feature, “Where’s My Refund?” to track the progress of your refund. You can
                         also find informative videos to help you understand your tax obligations on
                         YouTube, at www.youtube.com/irsvideos.
                            I would like to bring to your attention a couple of items that could be of help
                         as you file and pay your taxes this year. A number of federal tax incentives that
                         were enacted in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
                         are still in effect for 2010. These include the American Opportunity Credit and
                         the expanded Earned Income Credit. Make sure you check to see if you qualify
                         for these and other important deductions and credits.
                            Remember that the fastest and easiest way to get your refund is to e-file and
                         use direct deposit. You could receive your refund in as little as 10 days after
                         filing, which can help you pay bills, make some important purchases and maybe
                         put some money aside for savings.
                            E-file has become so popular that seven out of 10 individual taxpayers now
                         e-file their return. It’s the first choice for about 100 million taxpayers because
                         it’s fast, safe and accurate.
                            Taxpayers below a certain income level can qualify to use free tax
                         preparation software through the Free File program. Plus, everyone can e-file
                         for free using fillable forms available at IRS.gov. So, isn’t it time you made the
                         switch to e-file?
                            If you need any more information or have questions about taxes or tax
                         credits, please visit us at IRS.gov or call our toll-free number at

                                                                     Douglas H. Shulman

                                              instead of Pub. 535 to figure your deduction.

     (or the S corporation in which you were a more-than-2% shareholder) for 2010 for you, your
     spouse, and your dependents. Effective March 30, 2010, your insurance can also cover your child
     who was under age 27 at the end of 2010, even if the child was not your dependent. But do not
     include amounts for any month you were eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored health
     plan (see page 29) or amounts paid from retirement plan distributions that were nontaxable because
     you are a retired public safety officer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1.

 2b. If you pay self-employment tax, complete Schedule SE as a worksheet for purposes of this line.
     When completing Section A, line 3, or Section B, line 3, of the worksheet Schedule SE, treat the
     amount from Form 1040, line 29, as zero. Enter on this line the amount shown on that worksheet

 *If you used either optional method to figure your net earnings from self-employment, do not enter your net profit. Instead, enter the
    amount from Schedule SE, Section B, line 4b.
 **Earned income includes net earnings and gains from the sale, transfer, or licensing of property you created. However, it does not include
    capital gain income. If you were a more-than-2% shareholder in the S corporation under which the insurance plan is established, earned
    income is your Medicare wages (box 5 of Form W-2) from that corporation.

you use either of those worksheets to figure the tax on line 4 above. Complete the rest of that worksheet through line 6 (line 10 if you use
the Schedule D Tax Worksheet). Next, you must determine if you have a capital gain excess. To find out if you have a capital gain excess,
subtract Form 1040, line 43, from line 6 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet (line 10 of your Schedule D Tax
Worksheet). If the result is more than zero, that amount is your capital gain excess.
   If you do not have a capital gain excess, complete the rest of either of those worksheets according to the worksheet’s instructions. Then
complete lines 5 and 6 above.
   If you have a capital gain excess, complete a second Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet
(whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then complete lines 5 and 6
above. These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.
   1. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 3 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax
   Worksheet or line 9 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by your capital gain excess.
   2. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 2 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax
   Worksheet or line 6 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by any of your capital gain excess not used in (1) above.
   3. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount on your Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, by your capital gain excess.
   4. Include your capital gain excess as a loss on line 16 of your Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet on page D-9 of the
   Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040).

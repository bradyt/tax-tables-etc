Certain Cash Contributions for Typhoon Haiyan Relief Efforts
in the Philippines Can Be Deducted on Your 2013 Tax Return

A new law allows you to choose to deduct certain charitable contributions
of money on your 2013 tax return instead of your 2014 return. The
contributions must have been made after March 25, 2014, and before April
15, 2014, for the relief of victims in the Republic of the Philippines affected
by the November 8, 2013, typhoon. Contributions of money include
contributions made by cash, check, money order, credit card, charge card,
debit card, or via cell phone.

The new law was enacted after the 2013 forms, instructions, and
publications had already been printed. When preparing your 2013 tax
return, you may complete the forms as if these contributions were made on
December 31, 2013, instead of in 2014. To deduct your charitable
contributions, you must itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040) or
Schedule A (Form 1040NR).

The contribution must be made to a qualified organization and meet all
other requirements for charitable contribution deductions. However, if you
made the contribution by phone or text message, a telephone bill showing
the name of the donee organization, the date of the contribution, and the
amount of the contribution will satisfy the recordkeeping requirement.
Therefore, for example, if you made a $10 charitable contribution by text
message that was charged to your telephone or wireless account, a bill
from your telecommunications company containing this information
satisfies the recordkeeping requirement.

                                     The Taxpayer Advocate Service Is Here To Help You

What is the Taxpayer Advocate Service?
The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is your voice at the IRS. As an independent organization within the IRS, our job is to
ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that you know and understand your rights.

What can TAS do for you?
We can offer you free help with IRS problems that you can’t resolve on your own. We know the tax process can be confusing,
but the worst thing you can do is nothing at all! TAS can help if you can’t resolve your tax problem and:
      Your problem is causing financial difficulties for you, your family, or your business.
      You face (or your business is facing) an immediate threat of adverse action.
      You’ve tried repeatedly to contact the IRS but no one has responded, or the IRS hasn’t responded by the date promised.

If you qualify for our help, you'll be assigned to one advocate who’ll be with you at every turn and will do everything possible to
resolve your problem.
     TAS is an independent organization within the IRS. Our advocates know how to work with the IRS to get your problems
resolved.
     Our services are free and tailored to meet your needs.
     We have offices in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
     Our online tax toolkit can help you understand your rights and options in dealing with the IRS. Go to
www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Individuals/Get-Tax-Help.

How can you reach us?
If you think TAS can help you, call your local advocate, whose number is in your phone book and on our website at www.irs.gov/
advocate. You can also call us toll-free at 1-877-777-4778.

How else does TAS help taxpayers?
TAS also works to resolve large-scale, systemic problems that affect many taxpayers. If you know of one of these broad issues,
please report it to us through our Systemic Advocacy Management System at www.irs.gov/sams.


                                        Low Income Taxpayer Clinics Help Taxpayers

Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the IRS. Some serve individuals whose income is below a certain
level and who need to resolve a tax problem. These clinics provide professional representation before the IRS or in court on
audits, appeals, tax collection disputes, and other issues for free or for a small fee. Some clinics provide information about
taxpayer rights and responsibilities in many different languages for individuals who speak English as a second language. For
more information, and to find a clinic near you, read the LITC page on www.irs.gov/litc or IRS Publication 4134, Low Income
Taxpayer Clinic List. You can also get this publication at your local IRS office or by calling 1-800-829-3676.

   *If you were born on January 1, 1949, you are considered to be age 65 at the end of 2013.
   **Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt
   from tax, including any income from sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you
   can exclude part or all of it). Do not include any social security benefits unless (a) you are married filing a separate
   return and you lived with your spouse at any time in 2013 or (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your other
   gross income and any tax-exempt interest is more than $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see
   the instructions for lines 20a and 20b to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross
   income. Gross income includes gains, but not losses, reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D. Gross income from a
   business means, for example, the amount on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9. But, in figuring gross income, do
   not reduce your income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9.
   ***If you did not live with your spouse at the end of 2013 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at
   least $3,900, you must file a return regardless of your age.

unemployment compensation, taxable social security benefits, pensions, annuities, and distributions of unearned income from a

income is the total of your unearned and earned income.

        who did not withhold these taxes.

     the end of 2013, even if the child was not your dependent. But do not include amounts for any
     month you were eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored health plan or amounts paid from

*Enter the amount from line 3 above on line 1 of the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet if you
use either of those worksheets to figure the tax on line 4 above. Complete the rest of that worksheet through line 6 (line 10 if you use the
Schedule D Tax Worksheet). Next, you must determine if you have a capital gain excess. To find out if you have a capital gain excess, subtract
Form 1040, line 43, from line 6 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet (line 10 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet). If
the result is more than zero, that amount is your capital gain excess.
  If you do not have a capital gain excess, complete the rest of either of those worksheets according to the worksheet's instructions. Then
complete lines 5 and 6 above.
  If you have a capital gain excess, complete a second Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet
(whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then complete lines 5 and 6 above.
These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.
  1. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 3 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet
   or line 9 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by your capital gain excess.
  2. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 2 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet
   or line 6 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by any of your capital gain excess not used in (1) above.
  3. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount on your Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, by your capital gain excess.
  4. Include your capital gain excess as a loss on line 16 of your Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet in the Instructions for
   Schedule D (Form 1040).

                                    The Taxpayer Advocate Service Is Here To Help You


What is the Taxpayer Advocate Service?
The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is an independent organization within the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that helps
taxpayers and protects taxpayer rights. Our job is to ensure that every taxpayer is treated fairly and that you know and
understand your rights under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.

What can the Taxpayer Advocate Service do for you?
We can help you resolve problems that you can’t resolve with the IRS. And our service is free. If you qualify for our assistance,
your advocate will be with you at every turn and do everything possible. TAS can help you if:
     Your problem is causing financial difficulty for you, your family, or your business.
     You face (or your business is facing) an immediate threat of adverse action.
     You’ve tried repeatedly to contact the IRS but no one has responded, or the IRS hasn’t responded by the date promised.

How can you reach us?
We have offices in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Your local advocate’s number is at
www.TaxpayerAdvocate.irs.gov, at www.irs.gov/advocate, and in your local directory. You can also call us at 1-877-777-4778.

How can you learn about your taxpayer rights?
The Taxpayer Bill of Rights describes ten basic rights that all taxpayers have when dealing with the IRS. Our Tax Toolkit at
www.TaxpayerAdvocate.irs.gov can help you understand what these rights mean to you and how they apply. These are your
rights. Know them. Use them.

How else does the Taxpayer Advocate Service help taxpayers?
TAS works to resolve large-scale problems that affect many taxpayers. If you know of one of these broad issues, please report it
to us at www.irs.gov/sams.


                                        Low Income Taxpayer Clinics Help Taxpayers

Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) are independent from the IRS. Some serve individuals whose income is below a certain
level and who need to resolve a tax problem. These clinics provide professional representation before the IRS or in court on
audits, appeals, tax collection disputes, and other issues for free or for a small fee. Some clinics provide information about
taxpayer rights and responsibilities in many different languages for individuals who speak English as a second language. For
more information, and to find a clinic near you, read the LITC page on www.irs.gov/litc or IRS Publication 4134, Low Income
Taxpayer Clinic List. You can also get this publication at your local IRS office or by calling 1-800-829-3676.

                                                   Taxpayer Advocacy Panel

Have a suggestion for improving the IRS and do not know who to contact? The Taxpayer Advocacy Panel (TAP) is a diverse
group of citizen volunteers who listen to taxpayers, identify taxpayers’ issues, and make suggestions for improving IRS service
and customer satisfaction. The panel is demographically and geographically diverse, with at least one member from each state,
the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Contact TAP at www.improveirs.org or 1-888-912-1227 (toll-free).

   **Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt
   from tax, including any income from sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you
   can exclude part or all of it). Do not include any social security benefits unless (a) you are married filing a separate
   return and you lived with your spouse at any time in 2014 or (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your other
   gross income and any tax-exempt interest is more than $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see
   the instructions for lines 20a and 20b to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross
   income. Gross income includes gains, but not losses, reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D. Gross income from a

 Before you begin:                         Be sure you have read the Exception in the instructions for this line to see if you can use this
                                           worksheet instead of Pub. 535 to figure your deduction.
  1. Enter the total amount paid in 2014 for health insurance coverage established under your business
     (or the S corporation in which you were a more-than-2% shareholder) for 2014 for you, your
     spouse, and your dependents. Your insurance can also cover your child who was under age 27 at
     the end of 2014, even if the child was not your dependent. But do not include amounts for any
     month you were eligible to participate in an employer-sponsored health plan or amounts paid from
     retirement plan distributions that were nontaxable because you are a retired public safety

     plan is established, minus any deductions on Form 1040, lines 27 and 28. Do not include

  3. Self-employed health insurance deduction. Enter the smaller of line 1 or line 2 here and on
     Form 1040, line 29. Do not include this amount in figuring any medical expense deduction on

 *If you used either optional method to figure your net earnings from self-employment, do not enter your net profit. Instead, enter the
    amount from Schedule SE, Section B, line 4b.
 **Earned income includes net earnings and gains from the sale, transfer, or licensing of property you created. However, it does not include
   capital gain income. If you were a more-than-2% shareholder in the S corporation under which the insurance plan is established, earned
   income is your Medicare wages (box 5 of Form W-2) from that corporation.

*Enter the amount from line 3 above on line 1 of the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet if you
use either of those worksheets to figure the tax on line 4 above. Complete the rest of that worksheet through line 6 (line 10 if you use the
Schedule D Tax Worksheet). Next, you must determine if you have a capital gain excess. To find out if you have a capital gain excess, subtract
Form 1040, line 43, from line 6 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet (line 10 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet). If
the result is more than zero, that amount is your capital gain excess.
  If you do not have a capital gain excess, complete the rest of either of those worksheets according to the worksheet's instructions. Then
complete lines 5 and 6 above.
  If you have a capital gain excess, complete a second Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet
(whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then complete lines 5 and 6 above.
These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.
  1. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 3 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet
   or line 9 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by your capital gain excess.
  2. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 2 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet
   or line 6 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by any of your capital gain excess not used in (1) above.
  3. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount on your Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, by your capital gain excess.
  4. Include your capital gain excess as a loss on line 16 of your Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet in the Instructions for
   Schedule D (Form 1040).

                                                       Taxpayer Bill of Rights

 All taxpayers have fundamental rights they should be aware of when dealing with the IRS. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which
 the IRS adopted in June of 2014, takes existing rights in the tax code and groups them into the following 10 broad categories,
 making them easier to understand. Explore your rights and our obligations to protect them.
 The right to be informed. Taxpayers have the right to know what they need to do to comply with the tax laws. They are entitled
 to clear explanations of the laws and IRS procedures in all tax forms, instructions, publications, notices, and correspondence.
 They have the right to be informed of IRS decisions about their tax accounts and to receive clear explanations of the outcomes.
 The right to quality service. Taxpayers have the right to receive prompt, courteous, and professional assistance in their dealings
 with the IRS, to be spoken to in a way they can easily understand, to receive clear and easily understandable communications
 from the IRS, and to speak to a supervisor about inadequate service.
 The right to pay no more than the correct amount of tax. Taxpayers have the right to pay only the amount of tax legally due,
 including interest and penalties, and to have the IRS apply all tax payments properly.
 The right to challenge the IRS's position and be heard. Taxpayers have the right to raise objections and provide additional
 documentation in response to formal IRS actions or proposed actions, to expect that the IRS will consider their timely objections
 and documentation promptly and fairly, and to receive a response if the IRS does not agree with their position.
 The right to appeal an IRS decision in an independent forum. Taxpayers are entitled to a fair and impartial administrative
 appeal of most IRS decisions, including many penalties, and have the right to receive a written response regarding the Office of
 Appeals’ decision. Taxpayers generally have the right to take their cases to court.
 The right to finality. Taxpayers have the right to know the maximum amount of time they have to challenge the IRS’s position
 as well as the maximum amount of time the IRS has to audit a particular tax year or collect a tax debt. Taxpayers have the right
 to know when the IRS has finished an audit.
 The right to privacy. Taxpayers have the right to expect that any IRS inquiry, examination, or enforcement action will comply
 with the law and be no more intrusive than necessary, and will respect all due process rights, including search and seizure
 protections and will provide, where applicable, a collection due process hearing.
 The right to confidentiality. Taxpayers have the right to expect that any information they provide to the IRS will not be
 disclosed unless authorized by the taxpayer or by law. Taxpayers have the right to expect appropriate action will be taken against
 employees, return preparers, and others who wrongfully use or disclose taxpayer return information.
 The right to retain representation. Taxpayers have the right to retain an authorized representative of their choice to represent
 them in their dealings with the IRS. Taxpayers have the right to seek assistance from a Low Income Taxpayer Clinic if they
 cannot afford representation.
 The right to a fair and just tax system. Taxpayers have the right to expect the tax system to consider facts and circumstances
 that might affect their underlying liabilities, ability to pay, or ability to provide information timely. Taxpayers have the right to
 receive assistance from the Taxpayer Advocate Service if they are experiencing financial difficulty or if the IRS has not resolved
 their tax issues properly and timely through its normal channels.

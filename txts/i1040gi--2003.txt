A Message From                    Dear Taxpayer,
the Commissioner                    One of the unique features of our democracy is the generation of tax
                                  revenues through a system of individual self-assessment. As President
                                  Kennedy wrote in a special message to Congress more than 40 years ago,
                                  “The integrity of such a system depends upon the continued willingness of
                                  the people honestly and accurately to discharge this annual price of
                                  citizenship.” Those words remain as true today as when they were written
                                  in 1961.
                                    We at the IRS are committed to helping you understand and meet this
                                  important obligation. I want to assure you that, as we review your return, we
                                  will hold ourselves to the highest standards of fairness and consistency in
                                  determining your compliance with the law.
                                    I also would encourage you to e-file your return. IRS e-file is fast, safe,
                                  and accurate. You can find answers about e-file —and indeed many of your
                                  other tax questions—at our website at www.irs.gov.
                                    Thank you for taking the time to complete your return and for paying
                                  your taxes.

                                                                                       Sincerely,




                                                                                       Mark W. Everson




                                                    The IRS Mission
    Provide America’s taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax
    responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all.

      insurance,

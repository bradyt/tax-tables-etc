*Enter the amount from line 3 above on line 1 of the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet if you use
either of those worksheets to figure the tax on line 4 above. Complete the rest of that worksheet through line 6 (line 10 if you use the Schedule D
Tax Worksheet). Next, you must determine if you have a capital gain excess. To find out if you have a capital gain excess, subtract Form 1040,
line 43, from line 6 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet (line 10 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet). If the result is more
than zero, that amount is your capital gain excess.
   If you do not have a capital gain excess, complete the rest of either of those worksheets according to the worksheet’s instructions. Then
complete lines 5 and 6 above.
   If you have a capital gain excess, complete a second Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet
(whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then complete lines 5 and 6 above.
These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.

   Schedule D Tax Worksheet (but not below zero) by your capital gain excess.
   2. Reduce the amount you would otherwise enter on Form 1040, line 9b, (but not below zero) by any of your capital gain excess not used in (1)
   above.
   3. Reduce the amount on your Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, (but not below zero) by your capital gain excess.
   4. Include your capital gain excess as a loss on line 16 of your Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet on page D-9 of the Instructions for
   Schedule D (Form 1040).

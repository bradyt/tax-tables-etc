A Message From                    Dear Taxpayer,
the Commissioner                     Paying taxes is a unifying experience fundamental to democracy and the rule
                                  of law. Each year, almost two hundred million taxpayers carry out this vital
                                  obligation by filing their return. The Internal Revenue Service seeks to help
                                  people understand and pay taxes as easily as possible.
                                     More than half of all taxpayers file their taxes electronically. E-filing not
                                  only generates fewer errors than paper, but also ensures faster refunds. Many
                                  returns are e-filed by tax preparers, but increasing numbers come straight from
                                  home computers. Taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $50,000 or less
                                  can e-file for free. Instructions for electronic filing and Free File can be found
                                  on our website at www.irs.gov.
                                    To protect the honest taxpayer, we have strengthened enforcement of the tax
                                  laws. The vast majority of taxpayers pay honestly and accurately, and they have
                                  every right to expect their neighbors and competitors to do the same. Over the
                                  past several years, IRS audits and collections have risen significantly, and tax
                                  laws and regulations have been toughened.
                                     If you need more information about taxes, visit www.irs.gov. Learn how to
                                  file taxes, obtain tax forms, and find out if you are eligible for the earned

                                  useful to you.

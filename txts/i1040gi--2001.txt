A Message From         Dear Taxpayer:
the Commissioner          We know that preparing your tax return is not always an easy task. We at the IRS are working
                       as hard as we can, within the limits of the law, to make filing simpler and easier for you.
                          Here are some of the things we have done that may help you file and pay your taxes more
                       easily.
                       ● If you have capital gains, we have made the tax computation on Schedule D easier for most
                         taxpayers by removing 14 lines.
                       ● You can designate another person (such as your preparer, relative, or friend) to discuss your
                         return with the IRS to resolve questions that may arise in processing your return. Just fill out
                         the Third Party Designee section on your return.
                       ● If you have questions about how to fill out your return, you can get many of the answers 24
                         hours a day from our Frequently Asked Questions section on our popular web site at
                         www.irs.gov/tax_edu/faq/index.html.
                       ● If you need a form, you can download it directly from the IRS Web Site at www.irs.gov.
                       ● In most cases, you can now file your return and pay your taxes electronically without any
                         paper forms required. Just visit our web site and it will provide you a choice of many web
                         sites on which you can prepare your return and file it with the IRS. You can use a credit or
                         debit card to pay any balance due. Last year, over 40 million people filed electronically—and
                         got the benefits of much faster refunds, much less chance of receiving an error notice from the
                         IRS, and positive confirmation that their returns were received.
                       ● If you cannot file by April 15 and need an extension to file, you can get one automatically by
                         telephone by calling 1-888-796-1074. Remember, even if you get an extension, you still have to
                         pay any taxes due by April 15 and you can do this by phone as well.
                          We know there is a lot more for us to do to serve you better and we plan many more
                       improvements in the future. If you have specific suggestions how we can make it easier for you
                       to file and pay your taxes, please e-mail them to us through the IRS Web Site at
                       www.irs.gov/help/email2.html.
                                                                  Sincerely,

 You must file a return if any of the four conditions below apply for 2001.
 1. You owe any special taxes, such as:
    ● Social security and Medicare tax on tips you did not report to your employer,
    ● Uncollected social security and Medicare or RRTA tax on tips you reported to your employer or on group-term life insurance,
    ● Alternative minimum tax,
    ● Recapture taxes (see the instructions for lines 40 and 58 that begin on pages 33 and 39), or
    ● Tax on a qualified plan, including an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), or other tax-favored account. But if you are
      filing a return only because you owe this tax, you can file Form 5329 by itself.
 2. You received any advance earned income credit (EIC) payments from your employer. These payments are shown in box 9 of your
    W-2 form.
 3. You had net earnings from self-employment of at least $400.

                                     ⻫   Be sure you have read the Exception above to see if you can use this worksheet
                                         instead of Pub. 535 to figure your deduction.
 1. Enter the total amount paid in 2001 for health insurance coverage established under your business for

 4. Self-employed health insurance deduction. Enter the smaller of line 2 or line 3 here and on
    Form 1040, line 28. Do not include this amount in figuring any medical expense deduction on

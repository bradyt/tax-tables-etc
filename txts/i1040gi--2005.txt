A Message From                    Dear Taxpayer,
the Commissioner                     American taxpayers made history in 2005. For the first time, over half of all
                                  individuals filed their tax returns electronically. More than 68 million people
                                  “e-filed.” E-file is fast, secure, and accurate. The software catches errors that
                                  may otherwise hold up the processing of a paper return. Refunds come a lot
                                  sooner. I encourage you to consider this option. Taxpayers who file
                                  electronically prefer it.
                                     IRS.gov (www.irs.gov) was visited over 137 million times during last year’s
                                  filing season, making it one of the most used websites in America. IRS.gov
                                  provides ready access to all IRS forms and publications, answers to frequently
                                  asked questions, and interactive features, such as Where’s My Refund, the
                                  Withholding Calculator, and the EITC Assistant eligibility tool. In addition,
                                  Free File, also available through IRS.gov, provides free and convenient access
                                  to e-file. This free service was used by five million taxpayers last year.
                                    The IRS also answered over 33 million toll-free calls from taxpayers last
                                  year. We achieved an all-time high for the accuracy of our answers.
                                  IRS-sponsored volunteer return preparation has almost doubled since 1999,
                                  helping more than two million people file returns.
                                     As we improve services to taxpayers, the IRS continues to emphasize fair and
                                  balanced enforcement of the law. Americans have every right to be confident
                                  that when they pay their taxes, neighbors and competitors are doing the same.
                                     I hope this tax booklet is useful to you. For further information, you may

                                  for individuals and 1-800-829-4933 for businesses.
                                                                                       Sincerely,




                                                                                       Mark W. Everson

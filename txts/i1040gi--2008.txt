A Message From                    Dear Taxpayer,
the Commissioner                     U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. notably said “Taxes
                                  are what we pay for civilized society.” We should be proud that the vast
                                  majority of American citizens pay their taxes honestly and of their own free
                                  will. In an ever more complex and global world, we cannot take for granted this
                                  cornerstone principle of our democracy.
                                     For the IRS’s part, we owe it to all taxpayers to make the process of paying
                                  taxes as easy as possible. IRS employees are dedicated to helping taxpayers to
                                  quickly get their questions answered, complete their forms, pay their taxes, and
                                  get back to their lives. From the telephone representative who answers tax law
                                  questions, to the walk-in site employees who help low-income taxpayers, to the
                                  technicians that design and build our website – www.irs.gov – we are
                                  committed to providing top quality service.
                                     Unfortunately, there will always be some that cheat their fellow citizens by
                                  avoiding the payment of their fair share of taxes. The IRS owes it to the
                                  millions of you who promptly pay your taxes in full to pursue these people
                                  through strong enforcement programs. I believe this is a basic matter of
                                  fairness.
                                    If you need more information about taxes, I hope you’ll visit us online at
                                  www.irs.gov, or call us toll free at 1-800-829-1040. Your government works for
                                  you, so please do not hesitate to contact us if you need help.
                                                                                      Sincerely,




                                                                                      Douglas H. Shulman




                                                    The IRS Mission
    Provide America’s taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax
    responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all.

                                               instead of Pub. 535 to figure your deduction.


  1. Enter the total amount paid in 2008 for health insurance coverage established under your business
     (or the S corporation in which you were a more-than-2-percent shareholder) for 2008 for you, your
     spouse, and your dependents. But do not include amounts for any month you were eligible to
     participate in an employer-sponsored health plan or amounts paid from retirement plan distributions
     that were nontaxable because you are a retired public safety officer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                             1.

     plan is established, minus any deductions on Form 1040, lines 27 and 28 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                2.
  3. Self-employed health insurance deduction. Enter the smaller of line 1 or line 2 here and on
     Form 1040, line 29. Do not include this amount in figuring any medical expense deduction on

 * If you used either optional method to figure your net earnings from self-employment, do not enter your net profit. Instead, enter the
    amount from Schedule SE, Section B, line 4b.
 ** Earned income includes net earnings and gains from the sale, transfer, or licensing of property you created. However, it does not
    include capital gain income. If you were a more-than-2% shareholder in the S corporation under which the insurance plan is established,
    earned income is your Medicare wages (box 5 of Form W-2) from that corporation.

 you use either of those worksheets to figure the tax on line 4 above. Complete the rest of that worksheet through line 6 (line 10 if you use

 complete lines 5 and 6 above.
    If you have a capital gain excess, complete a second Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet
 (whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then complete lines 5 and 6
 above. These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.
    1. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 3 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax
    Worksheet or line 9 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by your capital gain excess.
    2. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on Form 1040, line 9b, by any of your capital gain excess not used
    in (1) above.
    3. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount on your Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, by your capital gain excess.

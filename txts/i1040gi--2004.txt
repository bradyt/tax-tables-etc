A Message From                    Dear Taxpayer,
the Commissioner                    As our nation moves forward in this still young century, the Internal Revenue
                                  Service will focus on three areas of tax administration:

                                  •   Improving taxpayer service;
                                  •   Enhancing enforcement of the tax law; and
                                  •   Modernizing the IRS through its people, processes, and technology.

                                     Our working equation at the IRS is simple: service plus enforcement equals
                                  compliance. Not service or enforcement, but service and enforcement. We must
                                  do both in a balanced and consistent manner, with full respect for, and attention
                                  to, taxpayer rights.

                                    By service, we mean helping people understand their federal tax obligations
                                  and facilitating their participation in the tax system. Enforcing the law is
                                  equally essential to our system of individual self-assessment. Americans need to
                                  be confident that when they pay their taxes, their neighbors and competitors are
                                  doing the same.

                                     As you prepare your taxes, I encourage you to file electronically. Last year,
                                  more than 61 million Americans did. And we expect even more to file
                                  electronically this year. E-file benefits both the taxpayer and the government.
                                  E-file promotes greater reliability and faster processing. If you’re getting a
                                  refund, you’ll get it sooner.

                                     To learn more, go online. Check out www.irs.gov and click on “1040
                                  Central” for the tax forms, information, and updates you need. For example,
                                  you can find out whether you are eligible for the earned income credit. Also,
                                  like more than 23 million people last year, you can check the status of your
                                  refund online. Just click on “Where’s My Refund?”

Chart C—Other Situations When You Must File
 You must file a return if any of the four conditions below apply for 2004.

 1.   You owe any special taxes, such as:
      • Social security and Medicare tax on tips you did not report to your employer,
      • Uncollected social security and Medicare or RRTA tax on tips you reported to your employer or on group-term life insurance,
      • Alternative minimum tax,
      • Recapture taxes (see the instructions for line 43, on page 33, and line 62, on page 40), or
      • Additional tax on a qualified plan, including an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), or other tax-favored account. But if you are
  filing a return only because you owe this tax, you can file Form 5329 by itself.
 2.   You received any advance earned income credit (EIC) payments from your employer. These payments are shown in
      Form W-2, box 9.
 3.   You had net earnings from self-employment of at least $400.

A Message From           Dear Taxpayer,
the Commissioner            As we enter the 2012 tax filing season, the IRS is always looking to find new
                         and innovative ways to help you get your tax questions answered. The newest is
                         our smartphone application, IRS2Go, which can be downloaded for free. You
                         can do a number of things with this app, such as checking the status of your tax
                         refund or subscribing to tax tips.
                            We also continue to enhance our website, IRS.gov, which is the most
                         convenient way to get tax information. We also post videos on YouTube to help
                         taxpayers understand their tax obligations. Check these out at www.youtube.
                         com/irsvideos. Our news feed on Twitter, @IRSnews, is another excellent
                         source of tax information.
                            Keep in mind that a number of federal tax incentives that were enacted in
                         2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act are still in effect
                         for 2011. These include the American opportunity credit and the expanded
                         earned income credit. Make sure to check to see if you qualify for these and
                         other important deductions and credits.
                            Remember that the fastest, safest and easiest way to get your refund is to
                         e-file and use direct deposit. E-file has become so popular that nearly eight out
                         of 10 individual taxpayers now e-file their return. It’s now the first choice for
                         about 112 million taxpayers.
                            Taxpayers below a certain income level can qualify to use free tax
                         preparation software through the Free File program. Plus, everyone can e-file
                         for free using a fillable form available at IRS.gov.
                            We know that it takes time to prepare and file a tax return, but the IRS wants
                         to help you fulfill your tax obligations and will continue to go the extra mile to
                         provide assistance.
                                                                       Sincerely,




                                                                     Douglas H. Shulman

  Provide America’s taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax
  responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all.

 *If you were born on January 1, 1947, you are considered to be age 65 at the end of 2011.
 **Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt from tax,
 including any income from sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you can exclude part or all of
 it). Do not include any social security benefits unless (a) you are married filing a separate return and you lived with your spouse at any
 time in 2011 or (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your other gross income and any tax-exempt interest is more than
 $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see the instructions for lines 20a and 20b to figure the taxable part of
 social security benefits you must include in gross income. Gross income includes gains, but not losses, reported on Form 8949. Gross
 income from a business means, for example, the amount on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9. But, in figuring gross income, do
 not reduce your income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9.
 ***If you did not live with your spouse at the end of 2011 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at least
 $3,700, you must file a return regardless of your age.

you use either of those worksheets to figure the tax on line 4 above. Complete the rest of that worksheet through line 6 (line 10 if you use
the Schedule D Tax Worksheet). Next, you must determine if you have a capital gain excess. To find out if you have a capital gain excess,
subtract Form 1040, line 43, from line 6 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet (line 10 of your Schedule D Tax
Worksheet). If the result is more than zero, that amount is your capital gain excess.
   If you do not have a capital gain excess, complete the rest of either of those worksheets according to the worksheet’s instructions. Then
complete lines 5 and 6 above.
   If you have a capital gain excess, complete a second Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or Schedule D Tax Worksheet
(whichever applies) as instructed above but in its entirety and with the following additional modifications. Then complete lines 5 and 6
above. These modifications are to be made only for purposes of filling out the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet above.
   1. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 3 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax
   Worksheet or line 9 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by your capital gain excess.
   2. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount you would otherwise enter on line 2 of your Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax
   Worksheet or line 6 of your Schedule D Tax Worksheet by any of your capital gain excess not used in (1) above.
   3. Reduce (but not below zero) the amount on your Schedule D (Form 1040), line 18, by your capital gain excess.
   4. Include your capital gain excess as a loss on line 16 of your Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet in the Instructions for
   Schedule D (Form 1040).

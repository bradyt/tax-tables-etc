A Message From                    Dear Taxpayer,
the Commissioner                     As another tax season begins, the IRS wants to make filing and paying your
                                  taxes as quick and easy as possible. We are trying to see things from your
                                  perspective so we can improve the quality and kinds of service we provide you.
                                  We want to help you successfully navigate a highly complex tax code and pay
                                  what you owe under the law—not a penny more, or a penny less.
                                     The American people who play by the rules every day further expect the IRS
                                  to vigorously enforce the tax law. Rest assured, we are pursuing those trying to
                                  evade paying their taxes.
                                     I also want to take this opportunity to make a pitch for e-file. If you received
                                  this 1040 package in the mail, the odds are that you are not enjoying the
                                  benefits of e-file. However, filing your taxes online was never easier. E-file is
                                  fast, secure, accurate, and taxpayers electing direct deposit can get their refunds
                                  in as little as 10 days. Therefore, you might want to give e-file a second look.
                                     For lower-income taxpayers and the elderly who don’t have access to a home
                                  computer and the Internet, there are thousands of convenient volunteer sites
                                  across the nation standing ready to prepare your return for free and e-file it to
                                  the IRS. Call our toll-free number at 1-800-829-1040 to find the one nearest to
                                  you.
                                     It is also important that taxpayers receive every tax credit for which they are
                                  eligible. This could mean extra money in your pocket as the American
                                  Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a number of new credits and expanded
                                  some existing ones.
                                     For example, qualifying taxpayers who bought a home in 2009 can claim a
                                  credit of up to $8,000 on either their 2008 or 2009 return. And the American
                                  Opportunity Tax Credit provides financial assistance of up to $2,500 to help
                                  offset tuition costs and other expenses for individuals pursuing a college
                                  education.
                                     In addition, the Earned Income Tax Credit was increased for families with
                                  three or more children, while the marriage penalty was reduced. Eligibility for
                                  the Additional Child Tax Credit also increased, meaning millions more
                                  low-income earners can claim it.
                                     If you need any more information or have questions about taxes or tax
                                  credits, please visit us online at www.irs.gov, or call us toll-free at

                                                                                      Sincerely,




                                                                                      Douglas H. Shulman

       Three Options for e-filing your returns—quickly, safely and easily.
              Last year more than 92 million Americans filed their returns electronically. Why?
                                  ● Faster refunds—in as little as 10 days with Direct Deposit.
                                  ● Easier filing since there are no paper returns to mail.
                                  ● Quick notification of receipt of your return.
                                  ● Confidence since the IRS uses the most secure technology available
                                    to safeguard your personal information.
                                  ● Freedom to file now and pay later.
                                  ● Help the environment by saving paper.

     spouse, and your dependents. But do not include amounts for any month you were eligible to

    amount from Schedule SE, Section B, line 4b.
 **Earned income includes net earnings and gains from the sale, transfer, or licensing of property you created. However, it does not include
    capital gain income. If you were a more-than-2% shareholder in the S corporation under which the insurance plan is established, earned
    income is your Medicare wages (box 5 of Form W-2) from that corporation.

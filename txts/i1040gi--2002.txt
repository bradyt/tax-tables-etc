 1. Enter the total amount paid in 2002 for health insurance coverage established under your business for
    2002 for you, your spouse, and dependents. But do not include amounts for any month you were eligible
    to participate in an employer-sponsored health plan or any amount on Form 8885, line 11                                      1.
